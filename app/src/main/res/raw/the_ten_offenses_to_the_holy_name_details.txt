While chanting the Hare Krsna mahamantra, one must remember that Lord Krsna and His name are non-different. With this, it is important to guard against any possible offenses or transgressions against the Holy Name. The word for offense is aparādha. The literal translation is “above the head of Radha.” She is the head of all devotees. Therefore, if one commits offenses towards devotees, it is like she is being struck from above. Therefore, to please Krsna, one must protect oneself and others from committing offenses.

The section of the Padma Purana, known as the Brahma Kanda, Chapter 25 Verses 15 through 18 describes ten offenses. These verses are filtered out to specifically show the offenses in these verses.
