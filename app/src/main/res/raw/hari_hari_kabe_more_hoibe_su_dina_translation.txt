1) When will I directly worship Sri Sri Radha and Krsna?  When will I be overwhelmed with love for the Divine Couple?  O Lord Hari, when will that auspicious day be mine? 

2) When, accompanying myself on a musical instrument, will I happily sing sweet songs describing the beautiful forms and qualities of the Divine Couple. 

3) When will I loudly call out "O Radhika, O Govinda," the tears from my eyes wetting my entire body. 

4) O Srila Rupa Gosvami, O Srila Sanatana Gosvami, O Srila Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, O Srila Jiva Gosvami, my life and soul, please be merciful to me this one time. 

5) O Lalita, O Visakha, O Sridama, O Subala and other friends of Lord Krsna, please be merciful to me this one time. 

6) All of You please be merciful to me and fulfill my desire.  This is the constant prayer of Narottama dasa.
