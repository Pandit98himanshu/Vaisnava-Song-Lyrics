Refrain: I offer prayer unto the lotus feet of the worshipful Lord Hari.

1-2) By His mercy, a lame person crosses mountains, a blind person sees everything, a deaf person hears, a dumb person again speaks, and even a poor person walks with a servant holding an umbrella over his head.

3) The Lord of Sura Dasa is full of compassion. Therefore, I offer my obeisances unto His lotus feet, again and again.
