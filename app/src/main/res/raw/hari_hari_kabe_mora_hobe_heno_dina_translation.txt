1) Oh my Lord Hari, when will such a day be mine? Developing love and attachment for a pure devotee, my material desires will thereby become weakened and subdued.

2) However I feel in the core of my heart, I will behave accordingly, totally free from duplicity. Without expecting any respect, I will give all honor unto others. I will constantly remain absorbed in ecstatic remembrance of the Lord by performing the congregational chanting of His holy names.

3) Just to pass this life I will perform only whatever minimum activity is required to maintain this body, and I will become attached only to that which is favorable for the worship of Lord Krsna.

4) I will forcibly reject whatever is unfavorable for His worship. Thus worshiping and worshiping, the time has come that I have to give up this body.

5) These are the hopes of Bhaktivinoda while living within the forest of Godruma. Hiding in secrecy, he continuously weeps with an extremely eager heart only for the purpose of receiving the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord.
