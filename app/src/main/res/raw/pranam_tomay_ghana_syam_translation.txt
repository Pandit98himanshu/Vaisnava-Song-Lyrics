Refrain: All obeisances to You, O Ghana-syam!

1) Taking refuge at Your lotus feet, now I will become fearless, O Lord! I will cross the ocean of miseries by the boat of Your Holy Name.

2) O Lord, we have fallen into sleep, while You are ever awake. Every moment we can only make errors, our eyes being covered by illusion.

3) Please remove this covering, my Lord, so I may behold Your form as the Divine Couple, with Sri Radha by Your side. I will gaze at You until my hankering eyes are pacified, thus fulfilling my soulâ€™s desire.
