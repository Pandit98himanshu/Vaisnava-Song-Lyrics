Refrain: Now that Syama has left Braja, who else will play the flute?

1) Since Syama has left Braja, the beautiful lotus-like Radharani is so unhappy that She is constantly weeping.

2) While decorating a forest bower with wildflowers, Radharani exclaims, “My dear friend, all night I lie awake weeping and trembling, because Syama will not be coming. He is no longer in Braja!”

3) Due to separation of Syama both male and female parrots are weeping, along with the cowherd girls of Braja. Syama is no longer playing the flute and the cows no longer go out to the pasture. “My dear friend, our life and soul, Krsna, has left Braja!”
