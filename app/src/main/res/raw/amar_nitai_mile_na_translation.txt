1) O naïve mind, I did not meet Nitai! I did not meet Gaura! Even though my entire body is covered with tilak, I did not meet Gaura!

2) How can you come across the love of Sri Gaura if you are not proper, internally and externally? If your worship is not proper, you will not find that gold (love of Sri Gaura)!

3) With cleansing of one’s mind, one can develop love for Sri Gaura. But if you develop love for decorating your body with tilak, you are not worshipping Lord Caitanya! (O my naïve mind, you are not worshipping Gaura!)

4) To that person who always respects this item (the love of Lord Caitanya), my merciful Nitai will be present at their home. If you call out with feelings of devotion, your austerity will become successful. (It will not become a failure!)
