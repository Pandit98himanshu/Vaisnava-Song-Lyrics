1) Please abide in the temple of my heart both day and night, O Krsna Murari, O Sri Krsna Murari!

2) Devotion, love, flower garlands, and sandalwood- please accept them, O Delighter of the Heart!

3) In life or in death I worship You with these offerings, Beautiful One, O Enchanter of the Heart!

4) Come, son of Nanda, and then, O Son of Nanda, I will offer Your arati ceremony with the lamplight of my love.

5) The waters of the Yamuna River cascade incessantly from my eyes in your separation, O Holder of Govardhana Hill!

6) May I pass my life absorbed only in songs of Your praise, O Krsna Murari, Sri Krsna Murari!
