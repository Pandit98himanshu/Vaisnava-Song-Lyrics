1) Hari! Obeisances to Lord Hari, unto Krsna, and Yadava. Obeisances to Lord of the Yadus, Madhava, Kesava.

2) Gopala! Govinda! Rama! O vanquisher of Madhu! Giridhari! Lord of the gopis! Bewilderer of cupid!

3) Sri Caitanya, Nityananda, Sri Advaita-Sita!  Hari! Guru! Vaisnavas! Srimad Bhagavatam! Bhagavad Gita!

4) All glories to Srila Rupa Goswami, Sanatana Goswami and Raghunatha Bhatta Goswami, to Srila Jiva Goswami, Gopala  Bhatta Goswami, and Raghunatha Dasa Goswami!

5) I bow to the feet of these six Goswamis. By their grace, our obstacles can be destroyed and all desires are fulfilled.

6) I am the servant of these six Goswamis. The dust of their lotus feet is my fivefold subsistence.

7) To be a servant of their lotus feet and to reside in the company of devotees--this is my aspiration birth after birth.

8) When these six Goswamis lived in Vraja, they revealed the eternal pastimes of Sri Sri Radha and Krsna.

9) In ecstasy, sing the name of Lord Hari and worship Vrndavana, joyfully fixing your mind upon the lotus feet of the bona-fide spiritual master and the pure devotees.

10) The lotus feet of my guru and the Vaisnavas are my aspiration. Narottama Dasa thus sings Hari-nama sankirtana.
