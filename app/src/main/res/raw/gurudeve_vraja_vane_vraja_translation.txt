1) (1) The Divine Master (2) Sri Vrndavana (3) The residents of Sri Vrndavana (4) The pure Vaisnavas (5) The brahmana section (6) The worshipful mantra (7) The holy name (8) A yearning to serve the Couple Divine: I adore these eight with utmost dedication. 

2) O dear mind, I implore thee at thy feet. Already we have learned the essence: nothing but Lord Krsna's service dispels the soul's illusory experience. 

3) Duty, knowledge, penance, meditation: all are really exploitation: none can free us from action and reaction; Cast them all aside, O my brother, sing the glory of good faith, our mother whose grace alone bestows pure devotion. 

4) Banish your pride forever, O my mind, your eight goals remember: adore them with a heart that is sincere. Aspiring for that devoted heart, at Sri Dasa Goswami's feet this Bhaktivinoda makes his prayer."
