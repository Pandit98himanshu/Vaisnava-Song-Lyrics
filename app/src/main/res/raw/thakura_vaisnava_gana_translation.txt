1) O saintly Vaisnavas, although I am very fallen and misbehaved, I still place this appeal before you:  My destiny has plunged me in the fearsome ocean of repeated birth and death.  Please grab me by the hair and pull me to the opposite shore.

2) My destiny is very powerful.  I am not able to hear the knowledge of spiritual life, and I am always bound by the ropes of karma.  I cannot see any way to escape my condition.  I see only suffering.  Helpless and stricken with grief, I cry.

3) My blind mind cannot see what path is auspicious or inauspicious.  My blind mind is helplessly dragged from here to there by lust, anger, greed, bewilderment, madness and pride.

4) My mind became immersed in the impermanent satisfaction of the senses, and I could not understand the real goal of life.  For this reason I did not aspire to attain Your lotus feet.  Narottama dasa says: Now that I am able to see, hear, and touch the Vaisnavas, I have become free from all fear.
