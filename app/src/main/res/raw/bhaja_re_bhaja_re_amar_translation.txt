1) My dear mind, how foolish you are! Oh just worship, oh just worship the lotus feet of Radha and Krsna in the forests of Vraja! (Oh, without such worship there is no means of spiritual advancement!) Just worship the lotus feet of Radha and Krsna in the forests of Vraja! (Oh, giving up all speculative knowledge and materialistic activities!)

2) Just worship Gaura, Gadadhara, Advaita, and Lord Nityananda, the original spiritual master! (Oh, knowing Lord Gaura and Lord Krsna to be the same!) (Oh, knowing the spiritual master to be very dear to Krsna!) Just remember the dear associates of Lord Caitanya, namely Srivasa Thakura, Haridasa Thakura, Murari Gupta, and Mukunda Datta! (Oh, in deep love for Lord Gaura, you should remember, just remember!) (Just remember the two great personalities Srivasa Thakura and Haridasa Thakura!)

3) Just remember Sri Rupa Goswami, Sanatana, Jiva, and the two Raghunathas! (Oh, if you are engaged in worshiping Lord Krsna!) (Just remember the two great souls Sri Rupa Goswami and Sanatana Goswami!) Just remember Raghava Pandita, Gopal Bhatta Goswami, Svarupa Damodara Goswami, and Ramananda Raya! (Oh, if you really seek love of Krsna!) (Just remember Svarupa Damodara Goswami and Ramananda Raya!)

4) Just remember Srila Kavi Karnapura and all his family members, especially his father, Sivananda Sena! (Oh, always remember, always remember!) (Sri Kavi Karnapura and his family!) Just remember all the sadhus who follow the path of Sri Rupa Goswami and who are absorbed in the ecstasy of bhajan! (Oh, if you actually want residence in the land of Vraja!) (Just remember the sadhus who are followers of Srila Rupa Goswami!)
