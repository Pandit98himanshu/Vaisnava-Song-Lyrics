1) Let me not have mystic powers, impersonal liberation, the Lord's association in Vaikuntha, or even pure love for Him, if instead of them I may reside in Vrndavana.

2) When Brahma and Uddhava, the crest jewels of devotees, saw the intense sweetness here, they begged to take birth here even as a blade of grass. For this reason I pray to reside in Vrndavana.

3) Here the gopis glorified the earth, saying: "O Earth, what austerities have you done, so that your surface is now marked with Krishna's footprints?" May I reside in Vrndavana.

4) May I reside in Vrndavana where, because the Vedas say raso vai sah (The Supreme Personality of Godhead is sweetness), transcendental sweetness attained its highest perfection in the gopis' passionate love.

5) Although only five yojanas in circumference, bounded by Bhandiravana, Govardhana Hill and the rasa-dance arena, it is unlimited in transcendental opulence. May I reside in Vrndavana.

6) Because Vrsabhanu's daughter is the queen, and because here the happiness of pure love of God rises, I yearn to live here. I pray: May I reside in Vrndavana.

7) Even by performing many austerities goddess Lakshmi could not enter the great rasa-dance pastime here. May I reside in the splendidly beautiful groves of Vrndavana.

8) May I reside in Vrndavana, where the ruru and nyanku deer fearlessly play, the cuckoos, bumblebees, and parrots sing, and the peacocks dance.

9) They who with great concentration read aloud this Vrndavanastaka, at the end of this life attain direct service to the lotus feet of Vrndavana's master.
