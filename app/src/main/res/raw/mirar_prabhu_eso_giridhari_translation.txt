(Refrain): The beautiful Syama is the Lord of Mirabai. Please come to me, Giridhari!

1) My heart, which is like the Jamuna River is restricted by its two banks, is now overflowing with divine love for You.

2) The kadamba tree of my mind is blooming with flowers that sway to and fro on the waves of divine love. O Hari, please come and play Your flute. You are the life and soul of Sri Radhika.

3) Mirabai says, â€œFor Your sake, O Syama, I gave up my home, and I have also given up my own family. In the same way that the gopis of Vraja cried out of separation from You, I also cry as Your loving devotee. Please keep this prayer of Your most unfortunate Mira at Your lotus feet and disregard my false pride.
