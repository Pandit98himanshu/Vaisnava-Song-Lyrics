1) O my mind, why don’t you worship Sri Gaurasundara, the crown-jewel of all incarnations? You always stay in water but your thirst is never satiated due to your own past bad activities.

2) You always hope to attain sweet, juicy fruits from your worship of thorn trees, but this is not possible. Our Gaurasundara is a desire-tree offering divine love, but you left Him, thinking Him to be poison.

3) O my mind, searching for some sweet aroma, you smell the beautiful palasa flower (but it has no scent), and instead, an insect from the flower enters your nose. You suck on dry wood, mistaking it for sugar cane, so how can you get any sweet juice?

4) O my mind, death is like snake which you put around your neck, thinking it to be a garland. You entered fire, thinking it to be cool, and suffered excruciating burning.

5) O my mind, enjoying material pleasures, you never heeded the devotees’ words and forgot Gaurasundara. Thus, both this world and the next are lost to you.
