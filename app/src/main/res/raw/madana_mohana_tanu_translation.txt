1) Graceful Lord Gauranga is more enchanting than Kamadeva. Glistening Vaisnava tilaka adorns His forheead.

2) He wears glorious trikaccha garments. His hair is curly. His two eyes are naturally restless.

3) Manifesting a very slender form, Lord Ananta has become His white sacred-thread.

4) On His lips rest betel nuts and a smile. Vrndavana dasa worships Him.
