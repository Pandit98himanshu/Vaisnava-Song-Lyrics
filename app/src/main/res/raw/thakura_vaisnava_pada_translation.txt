1) O brother, please hear my words with rapt attention.  The lotus feet of the Vaisnavas are the most valuable treasure of this world.  These Vaisnavas continually take shelter of Lord Krsna and worship Him.  They never abandon their Lord.  They are liberated.  They are free from the cycle of birth and death.

2) The water that has washed the lotus feet of the Vaisnavas bestows devotional service in pure love of God.  Nothing else is as effective for attaining this divine love.  I place dust from the lotus feet of the Vaisnavas upon my head.  I wear no other ornament.

3) The purifying power of the waters at the various holy places of pilgrimage is described in the Puranas, although this is something of a deceptive trick.  Actually there is not anything as purifying as the water that has washed the lotus feet of the Vaisnavas.  This water fulfills all desires.

4) Moment after moment my mind finds pleasure in the association of the Vaisnavas.  I always seek out the company of those who are devoted to Lord Krsna.  Poor-hearted Narottama dasa breaks down and cries.  How has this fallen condition come upon me?
