Refrain: The queen Mira is simply a beggar-woman, but only for Your sake, O Giridhari!

1) I simply wander here and there like a mendicant, but I seek only the alms of Your holy name.

2) People say, “Mira has become a madwoman.” The King says, “She has disgraced her family.” But Mira says, “O Lord Giridhari, my only desire is to remain at Your lotus feet.”

3) In this life, Mira has become unfortunate! Being separated by Syama, I have become forever longing in separation. O Prabhuji! Kindly reveal Yourself to me! Mira simply weeps for You, my Lord. Please don’t make this most unfortunate person cry any more. Please keep me tightly embraced, as if united with Your own body.

4) O Giridhari! You are the life and soul of Mira! Only for Your sake, Giridhari!
