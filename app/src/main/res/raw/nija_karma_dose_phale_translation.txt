1) Oh my dear Lord Hari! By the bad fruits of my past evil activities, I have slipped and fallen into the waters of the ocean of nescience, and I have been thus bobbing and sinking beneath the waves for a very, very long time. Swimming, I have not been able to reach the shore of this ocean of material existence, for it extends for an unlimitedly vast distance.

2) Becoming completely submerged and drowned in this ocean, I have loudly called out with a greatly distressed voice for someone to come and rescue me. At that time You came to me, oh Lord. Knowing that You are the safe shelter at the shore of this fearful ocean has gien me a ray of hope.

3) You, dear Lord, are actually made of compassion. I am completely convinced that You are the original source of the highest form of causeless mercy. Now this most fallen rascal Bhaktivinoda won't reject You any more... for I, the befitting object of causeless mercy, have attained the favor of He Who abounds in causeless mercy.
