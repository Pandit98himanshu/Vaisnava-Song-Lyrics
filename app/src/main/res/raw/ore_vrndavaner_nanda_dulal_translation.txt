1) O dear one who belongs to Vrndavana! O darling son of Nanda Maharaja! O prince of the cowherd boys, kindly play again on Your flute so we may hear the melodies dear to all Your friends.

2) O Gopal, since You’ve left Vrndavana, the flowers have lost their desire to bloom. Still we decorate the moonlit groves of Madhuvana, hoping You will return for Your amorous rendezvous.

3) Sridama, Sudama, and Your brother Balarama are calling, “O Kanai! Please come back!” While tending the calves and playing on their flutes they entreat, “O brother! Please come home!”

4) Mother Yasoda is crying out, “O Gopal! You are my life and soul! Please come home, O butter thief!” Within the heart of Srimati Radharani, divine love for You flows like the Yamuna River.
