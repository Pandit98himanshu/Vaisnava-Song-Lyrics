1) O brothers, chant "Hari!" Chant "Hari!" Chant "Hari!" Lord Gauranga and Lord Nitai have brought the holy name! (Seeing our unhappiness!)

2) Except for the holy name, there is no other treasure for the soul! By the influence of the holy name, even Jagai and Madhai became pure! (They were both greatly sinful persons!)

3) I pass my life uselessly bound by Maya! (Always saying "I" and "mine"!) Wandering here and there under the control of mundane desires-where shall I go next? (There is no end to worldly desires!)

4) O brothers, chant "Hari!" while looking directly in the face of material desire! (Freedom from mundane hankerings is the platform of actual happiness!) Giving up all desire for mundane enjoyment and liberation, I chant the holy names of the Supreme Lord! (Having become pure and situated in transcendence!)

5) I dance in ecstasy due to the power and divine qualities of the holy name, and thus I obtain all these results! (Having given up all endeavors for insignificant material results!) Bhaktivinoda says, "I conquer all impediments to the pure chanting of the holy name! (Having given up all offenses to the holy name!)"
