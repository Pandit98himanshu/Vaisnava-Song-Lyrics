Refrain: Oh, why does my heart not weep from chanting the holy names Hare Krsna?

1) The bird of my heart does not know what past sinful activities in has committed to cause this inability to chant Hare Krsna properly.

2) O forest bird! I have kept something for you very carefully within the cottage of my heart – the holy name of Hari, which is overflowing with pure sweet honey. O bird, you could learn the chanting of this name if you were taught.

3) A bird is easily able to speak all names; why then does this bird of my heart refuse to chant Hare Krsna? Oh, why does my heart not weep from chanting the holy names Hare Krsna?

4) O bird! Come, let us go to the spiritual world, the land of true and everlasting beauty. It is the place where the imaginary man of my mind will never again come and go on the revolving cycle of birth and death.

5) O bird! At the time of death, your body will simply be placed upon a funeral stretcher, lifted on the shoulders of four persons and carried to the cremation grounds.

6) Alas! The cremation fire will enter your mouth and then totally consume your tongue. There will be nothing you can do to save yourself; for at that time, it is too late – you will be unable to speak anymore.
