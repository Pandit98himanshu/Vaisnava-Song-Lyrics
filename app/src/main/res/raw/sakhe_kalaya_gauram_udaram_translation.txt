1) My friend! That most magnanimous Sri Gauranga Mahaprabhu has appeared as the rising sun to dispel the darkness of this age Kali.

2) His brilliant golden complexion shames the bright luster of gold, and His beauty defeats the pride of Cupid. His curly black hair is decorated with a garland made of malati flowers, and bumble bees fly around them.

3) His beautiful moonlike face is decorated with tilaka, and His dressing enchants the whole world. His sweet smile delivers all embodied souls from the mire of material existence, by generating in them greed for love of Godhead. He displays unique ecstatic symptoms.

4) He Hankering to relish the unparalleled pastimes of the greatly munificent Sri Gaurasundara, who distributes mercy in the form of nama-prema to the supremely fortunate niskincana souls (those whose only possession is love of Krishna), the fallen and foolish Radha-mohana sings in a mood of great distress
