1) When will Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu show His causeless mercy to me by allowing me to attain the shade of the lotus feet of all the Vaisnavas?

2) When will I be able to give up this false ego which is so deeply engrossed in sense gratification? And when will I be able to properly honor the associates of the Lord?

3) I will stand before the Vaisnavas with folded hands, a cloth binding my neck, and a straw in between my teeth, sincerely awaiting their order.

4) Weeping and weeping, I will understand the real nature of this abode of misery, and I will beg for relief from the blazing fire of this material world.

5) Hearing about all of my miserable sufferings, the Vaisnavas Thakura will submit an appeal unto the Lord Krsna on my behalf.

6) By the prayer of the Vaisnavas the all-merciful Lord Krsna will then become compassionate towards such a sinner as me.

7) Bhaktivinoda's prayer unto the lotus feet of the Vaisnavas is that: "Please be merciful and take this worthless person into your association".
